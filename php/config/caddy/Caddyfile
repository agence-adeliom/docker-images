# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * {$DOCUMENT_ROOT:/var/www/html/}

    encode zstd gzip
    templates

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    php_fastcgi localhost:9000
}
